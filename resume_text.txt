Experience
McMaster Mars Rover |Electrical Team Lead & Battery Subsystem Lead September 2024–Present
•Leading & Managing all members of the Electrical Team to develop a fully functioning V3 Rover Electrical
System, overseeing both Schematic & PCB reviews , board validation, and assembly.
•Developing a custom 6-layer Battery Management System (BMS) PCB featuring an STM32, passive
balancing, protection circuits, and high-accuracy current/voltage sensing for rover telemetry.
•Designed and validated a 4-layer Teensy 4.1 -based communication board integrating GPSandLoRamodules
withdual RF power domains , fan controllers, a servo driver, and diagnostic indicators for telemetry and
autonomous control operations.
•Assembled and tested 15+ 24 V stepper motor controller boards , evaluating electrical performance, efficiency,
and thermal stability under varying mechanical loads.
•Developed and validated a 6-layer, 4-phase 48 V →24 V buck converter with integrated fault indicators,
soft-start behavior, custom thermal mitigation, and an output protection stage .
Onside AI |Computer Vision & Machine Learning Intern October 2025 – Present
•Designed a vision-based AI detection system that integrates object recognition, behavioral cues, and apparel
classification, optimized for multi-class security-camera perception.
•Trained and refined multiple YOLO models inPython/PyTorch , including a dual-model architecture to
address class-imbalance issues, improve stability, and achieve accurate real-time inference .
•Developed a multimodal analysis pipeline that combines YOLO detections with contextual reasoning based on
VLM, allowing for improved state-classification and reduced chance of false positives.
Dentra |Electrical Design Intern May 2025 – Aug 2025
•Developed electrical schematics and prototype circuits for wearable dental diagnostic hardware, validating
performance through PSpice simulations.
•Collaborated within the hardware team to design and test power delivery subsystems, including LDO regulators ,
LiPo charging circuits , andUV LED drivers under varying load and thermal conditions.
•Supported schematic bring-up in Altium Designer , advising on component selection, PCB layout practices, and
grounding, trace width, and thermal management design parameters.
•Ensured hardware safety and performance by integrating temperature-protection features and validating current
limits,voltage tolerances , and thermal margins through iterative bench testing.
Culinary Compass |Machine Learning & Data Science Intern March 2025 – July 2025
•Contributed to the design of multiple AI-driven menu recommendation systems , achieving up to 95%
precision in recommendation relevance.
•Conducted structured technical reviews of LLM-based, embedding-based, and TF-IDF + cosine similarity
models, comparing performance across synthetic user profiles using an LLM judge.
Projects
•Electric Scooter Soldering, C++, 3D Printing September 2025
Designed and built a custom electric scooter integrating a BLDC motor, ESC, throttle speed control , a
tack-welded Li-ion battery pack, BMS, and an onboard speed/data display .
•Blurify: Fast & Easy Video Blurring Python, OpenCV, MoviePy, Streamlit June 2025
Built an AI blurring web app at SpurHacks 2025 to detect and blur sensitive elements in videos. Used OpenCV
for processing, MoviePy for synchronization, and deployed via Streamlit .
•Smart Watch Python, Flask, React, ESP32, OpenCV, EasyOCR, C++ March 2025
Built an assistive watch for a client with Usher’s Syndrome using an ESP32 camera and Flaskserver. The
device reads labels at the push of a button and does TTS, Achieved 85% accuracy and added
temperature-based audio alerts .
